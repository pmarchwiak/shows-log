# SHOWS LIST

I've been keeping a list of shows I've attended in a spreadsheet for a long time.

This is a little statically generated website based on that data.


## commands
Start a dev server:
```
make dev
```

Run tests:
```
make test
```

Download the google sheet as a TSV:
```
make download
```

Convert the TSV to a JSON file:
```
make convert
```

Run static export:
```
make build
```

Deploy the static directory:
```
make deploy
```

## TODO
- fix static export
- clean up css
- improved show page layout
- have image gallery fit page better
- stats page
- video: embed youtube, show video icon
- audio: embed bandcamp
