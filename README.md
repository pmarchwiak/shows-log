# SHOWS LIST

I've been keeping a list of shows I've attended in a spreadsheet for a long time.

This is a little statically generated website based on that data.

## TODO
- fix static export
- improved show page layout, including photos
- stats page
- video: embed youtube, show video icon

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
